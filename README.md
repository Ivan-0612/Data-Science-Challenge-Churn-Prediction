# Data-Science-Challenge-Churn-Prediction
## Objective:
The goal of this analysis was to predict customer churn in a video streaming service to help improve retention strategies

## Approach:
I used logistic regression to build the predictive model, transforming categorical variables using One-Hot Encoding and Label Encoding, and splitting the data into features and the target variable.

## Solution:
The model achieved an accuracy of 0.7478 in predicting whether a customer would drop out of the service. This could allow the company to focus on high-risk users and implement targeted retention strategies, ultimately improving customer retention.
