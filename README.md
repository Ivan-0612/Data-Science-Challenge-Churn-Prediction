# Data-Science-Challenge-Churn-Prediction
In this project, I faced a machine learning challenge related to predicting customer churn in a video streaming service. My task was to build a model capable of predicting which subscribers would continue their subscription for the next month.

To address this challenge, I used a dataset that includes information from subscribers who started their subscription in 2021, with details about their behaviour up to the date they decided to cancel. Cancellation depends on several variables such as content saturation, lack of time or the perception that the service is no longer needed. Also, I used a logistic regression model to make de predictions.
